Description
===========
Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) is a
software application designed for molecular dynamics simulations. It has
potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductor), soft matter
(biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. It can be
used to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at
the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.

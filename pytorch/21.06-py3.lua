Description
===========
PyTorch is a GPU accelerated tensor computational framework with a Python front
end. Functionality can be easily extended with common Python libraries such as
NumPy, SciPy, and Cython. Automatic differentiation is done with a tape-based
system at both a functional and neural network layer level. This functionality
brings a high level of flexibility and speed as a deep learning framework and
provides accelerated NumPy-like functionality.

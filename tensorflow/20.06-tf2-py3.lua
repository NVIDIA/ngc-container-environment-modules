Description
===========
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them. This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one or
more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.

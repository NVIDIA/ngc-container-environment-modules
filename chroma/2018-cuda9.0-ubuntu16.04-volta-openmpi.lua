Description
===========
The Chroma package provides a toolbox and executables to carry out calculation
of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD). It is built on top of the QDP++ (QCD
Data Parallel Layer) which provides an abstract data parallel view of the
lattice and provides lattice wide types and expressions, using expression
templates, to allow straightforward encoding of LQCD equations.
